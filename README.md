# Princeton-Algorithms-Solutions
Solutions For First Part Of Two Part Course on Algorithms and Data Structures Taught At Princeton.
All solutions strictly follow course guidelines and assignment specifications. In other words, I only used data structures and libraries that were explicitly allowed in the assignment and covered in the lectures/textbook.
Last, all solutions received a score of 99 or above except for assignment 1 which received 94/100 because of an error in Percolation that allowed backwash.
